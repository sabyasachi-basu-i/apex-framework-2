# APEX Framework – Overview

APEX (Agentic Platform for Enterprise Execution) is Tytan Technology’s unified framework for building, orchestrating and governing enterprise‑grade agentic systems.  It provides a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns, enabling both rapid prototyping and production deployments.

The framework is structured into **six layers**, each responsible for a specific part of the architecture:

1. **Intelligence Layer** – reasoning, memory and knowledge retrieval.
2. **Integration Layer** – connectivity to enterprise systems such as ERPs, CRMs, databases and data lakes.
3. **Orchestration Layer** – multi‑step flows and multi‑agent coordination.
4. **Action Layer** – execution of actions via API calls, RPA bots and webhooks.
5. **Governance Layer** – security, roles, audit, observability and compliance.
6. **Experience Layer** – human‑AI collaboration via web, chat, voice or embedded UI widgets.

These layers combine to form the **APEX runtime**, deployable on your infrastructure.  APEX is designed to be both flexible and opinionated: you can adopt the entire stack or integrate individual layers into your existing systems.

For a deeper dive into each layer, consult the separate documentation files in this directory.  For the overall system design, see `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
